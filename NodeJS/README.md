# NodeJS

These are a few projects that are the result of a learning process.
In this repository, the focus is on Node.js and the Express framework.
Some of the files are the result of following the tutorials on thenewboston.com, and others from udemy.com
The files are not necessarily precisely as they are represented in those tutorials, as they are reproduced from memory as an experimentation exercise.
