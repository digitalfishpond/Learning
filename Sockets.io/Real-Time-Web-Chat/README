In order to run: copy contents of repo to an empty folder on your PC (quite high up on your pc's directory if using Windows to avoid 'distinguished name is too long' errors.

After installing Node, open cmd/terminal in the top folder (containing package.json) and run: npm install 

This will add all the dependencies mentioned in the package.json

Then just run: 'node app.js' in the terminal and open localhost:3700 in two seperate browsers/tabs
