# AngularJS-learning
Example/exercise files and notes produced throughout my learning of AngularJS

These examples were produced following the course 'Learn and Understand AngularJS' by Anthony Alicea hosted by Udemy 
https://www.udemy.com/learn-angularjs/#/

All of these files were reproduced from scratch as a way for me to learn new concepts presented in the course, so I cannot guarantee that they are identical to the ones presented in the course, but they have all been thoroughly tested, and cover the topic in the title in a representative way.
