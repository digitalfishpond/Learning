<h3>Search Results</h3>
<div class="list-group">
    <!-- The custom Directive has specified the property 'scope' so its scope is now isolated for safety, 
    and the properties on the Controller of the code that called it are no longer available to it by default. 
Here, in the div with the attribute 'search-result' (that calls the searchResult custom directive), We have 
added a custom attribute randomely named 'person-object'. It contains the value 'person' which is the name of 
the object from the parent Controller that is needed. Combined with the changes in the custom directive in app.js, 
this will allow passage through scopes for that one object-->
    <div search-result person-object="person"></div>
</div>
